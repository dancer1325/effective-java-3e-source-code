* Language's areas == grammar + vocabulary + daily common usage
* 💡programming language == core language + vocabulary + effective ways to use & structure your code 💡
  * core language
    * == which type? (algorithmic, functional, object-oriented?)
    * _Example:_ | Java programming language
      * object-oriented / 1! inheritance
      * imperative (statement-oriented) coding style | EACH method
        ```
        // Imperative style
        public int calculateSum(int[] numbers) {
            int sum = 0;                     // Mutable state
            for (int i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {  // Step-by-step iteration
                sum += numbers[i];           // Modifying the sum variable
            }
            return sum;
        }
        ```
  * vocabulary
    * == data structures + operations + standard libraries
    * _Example:_ | Java programming language
      * 's libraries -- address -- graphic display support, networking, distributed computing, security, ...
  * effective ways to use & structure your code
    * MOST complex to find | books 
    * ⚠️== how the community uses it + organized code / easy to modify ⚠️
      * Reason: 🧠program language change | time 🧠
    * _Example:_ | Java programming language
      * ⭐️book's goal ⭐️
